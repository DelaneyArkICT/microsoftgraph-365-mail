This package makes a wrapper around the Microsoft Graph API. It provides a mail driver (send mails via office365) and a storage driver (use OneDrive as a Laravel disk). It also gives the ability to easily interact with Microsoft teams.
This package also provides the possibliity to work with Excel files loaded from OneDrive, making it possible to write and read Excel files.

You need to register an app in the Microsoft Azure Portal to use this package. Follow the steps in the Microsoft docs:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require lloadout/microsoftgraph
```

Add this to your .env file and fill it with the values you specified in Microsoft Azure Portal app registration.

```
MS_TENANT_ID=
MS_CLIENT_ID=
MS_CLIENT_SECRET=
MS_GRAPH_API_VERSION=v1.0
MS_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-url.com/microsoft/callback
```

## Connect your account

The package uses OAuth and provides two routes

The first redirects you to the consent screen of Microsoft

```
https://your-url.com/microsoft/connect
```

The second is the callback url you need to specify in Microsoft Azure Portal app registration as redirect uri

```
https://your-url.com/microsoft/callback
```

The callback will fire an MicrosoftGraphCallbackReceived event, this will automatically store your token in the session. You can add your token store logic in a listener for this event, for example:

```
Event::listen(function (MicrosoftGraphCallbackReceived $event) {
    $user = Auth::user();
    $user->accessdata = $event->accessData;
    $user->save();
});
```

The package will search for a session variable name `microsoftgraph-access-data` for establishing the connection. So please provide this variable with your accessData as value when logging in.
For example:  On login, you get your accesData from the database and store it into the session variable `microsoftgraph-access-data`.
